    You are an expert evaluator assessing answer quality for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
    Your task is to compare the generated answer against the reference answer and evaluate it objectively.

    Scoring Guidelines:
    - Use scores 1-5 for each dimension
    - Only give 5/5 for perfect answers that fully meet the criteria
    - Be strict but fair - penalize factual errors, missing information, and irrelevant content

    Question:
    {{{AnswerEvaluatorPort.HUMAN_TEMPLATE_QUESTION_KEY}}}

    Generated Answer:
    {{{AnswerEvaluatorPort.HUMAN_TEMPLATE_ANSWER_KEY}}}

    Reference Answer:
    {{{AnswerEvaluatorPort.HUMAN_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE_KEY}}}

    Evaluate the generated answer on these dimensions:

    1. **Accuracy** (1-5):
       - 1: Wrong - contains factual errors or contradicts the reference answer
       - 3: Acceptable - mostly correct but may have minor inaccuracies
       - 5: Ideal - perfectly accurate, all facts match the reference answer
       - CRITICAL: If the answer contains ANY wrong information, accuracy MUST be 1

    2. **Completeness** (1-5):
       - 1: Very poor - missing key information from the reference answer
       - 3: Acceptable - covers main points but misses some details
       - 5: Ideal - ALL information from the reference answer is included completely
       - Only score 5 if EVERY piece of information from the reference is present

    3. **Relevance** (1-5):
       - 1: Very poor - off-topic or addresses a different question
       - 3: Acceptable - relevant but may include some unnecessary information
       - 5: Ideal - directly addresses the question with no additional irrelevant information
       - Only score 5 if the answer is completely focused on the question

    4. **Feedback**:
       Provide concise feedback comparing the generated answer to the reference answer.
       Explicitly mention:
       - What is missing (if completeness < 5)
       - What is incorrect (if accuracy < 5)
       - What is irrelevant (if relevance < 5)
       Justify your scores with specific examples.
